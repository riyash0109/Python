Python program to take date as input
A program which accepts as input a DOB in the format “dd/mm/yyyy “and prints one positive quality of the Zodiac sign he/she belongs to. Validate the input

· If no input is given print your zodiac sign positive quality

· If “?” is typed help the user by telling him/her to enter Data of Birth in the required format

· If date is entered validate the correctness of the date

· If “q” or “Q” is entered invoke a user defined exception which quits the program after printing “Bye! Hope you run this program again”.
